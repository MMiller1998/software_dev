## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. point to the functinality for retrieving the cities from the game-map representation 

   - its signature and/or purpose statement
     - [Signature and purpose statement](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/43ca0f116a8f8dc01ffe08912f532433262921bd/Trains/Common/map.py#L145-L148)
   - its unit test(s)
      - [Unit test](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/43ca0f116a8f8dc01ffe08912f532433262921bd/Trains/Other/tests/test_map.py#L70-L73)


2. point to the functinality for determining all feasible destinations from the game-map representation

   - its signature and/or purpose statement
     - [Signature and purpose statement](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/43ca0f116a8f8dc01ffe08912f532433262921bd/Trains/Common/map.py#L164-L169)
   - a basic unit test
     - [basic test](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/43ca0f116a8f8dc01ffe08912f532433262921bd/Trains/Other/tests/test_map.py#L86-L91)
   - a unit test with at least one pair of cities that aren't connected via some path
     - [test with disconnected cities](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/43ca0f116a8f8dc01ffe08912f532433262921bd/Trains/Other/tests/test_map.py#L86-L91)

The basic test and test with disconnected cities are the same test.


The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
