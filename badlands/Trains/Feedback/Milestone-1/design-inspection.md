Additional comments:

To answer the fourth question, which regards performance metrics: You will not be evaluated on the basis of performance in this class, but I commend the idea and challenge you to define and hold yourself accountable to your own performance metrics, if you chose to spend time on that (focus on the course requirements first).

In the future, when asked to write a list, it will be helpful to enumerate (with numbers) items on the list (of questions, in this case) to offer a point of reference back to list items.

Evaluation criteria:

+5 pts: data structure constructors from your chosen PL (Class)

+5 pts: types or type-like descriptions of how they are used

+5 pts: minimal interpretation and assumptions

+5 pts: allow visual and connectivity functionality based on those

Additional comments:

Data definition is well-organized and specific. Nicely done. I would like to point out, however, that the name "DirectedConnection," may be misleading, as the connections on the Train game map are not directed in terms of the graph theory definition of "directed."
