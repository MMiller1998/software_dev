## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 4

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. the method/function header for determining all connections available for
   acquisition plus at least one unit test 
      - [Method header](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/master/Trains/Common/player_game_state.py#L36)
      - [Unit test](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/master/Trains/Other/tests/test_player_game_state.py#L90-L94)

2. the method/function header for deciding the legality of an acquisition
   request from a player to the referee,  plus at least two unit tests
      - [Method header](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/master/Trains/Admin/referee_game_state.py#L58)
      - [Unit tests](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/master/Trains/Other/tests/test_referee_game_state.py#L69-L80)

3. the method/function header for producing a player-game state from a
   referee-game state,  plus a unit test 
      - [Method header](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/master/Trains/Admin/referee_game_state.py#L47)
      - [Unit test](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/badlands/blob/master/Trains/Other/tests/test_referee_game_state.py#L55-L66)

The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
