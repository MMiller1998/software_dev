- "- 0/10: `more_cards`" We were missing the more cards function in the player actor class.

- "10/20 pts for unit tests of the choose-action for buy-now (>= 1 for checking "acquire a connection", >= 1 for checking "give me more cards")"

  - Test coverage was expanded in https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F21/hammond-pond/commit/8e31a0e2dcbede4b3fff389760f506d90bb32691
