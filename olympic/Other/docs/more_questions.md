# More Questions

Questions we had about game rules which did not fit into Milestone 1's submission.

#### Is there a difference between "acquiring" and "occupying" a connection?

#### Can a game board have separate graphs in them?

For example, let's say we had a map with the cities `MRTL`, `IAD`, `BOS`, `BWI`
with the connections `MRTL - IAD` and `BOS - BWI` but no connections from
`MRTL - BOS`, `MRTL - BWI`, `IAD - BOS`, or `IAD - BWI`.
