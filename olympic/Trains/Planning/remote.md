# Data Definitions

All data is represented as JSON. JSON data definitions are re-used from the various specifications in milestone testing tasks.

The `Destination` name is shortened to `Dest` for diagram convenience.

The pieces of data not defined in milestones are:
- A `*Boolean*` is a JSON boolean, `true` or `false`
- An `*Integer*` is a JSON *number* with no *fraction*

Please see https://www.json.org/json-en.html for further JSON specification details.

The notation `DataType[]` means "an array of arbitrary size with elements `DataType`.

The notation `[DataType1, DataType2]` means "an array of length 2 where the first element is a `DataType1` and the second element is a `DataType2`.

# Explanations

The `server` calling methods on `client`s will work via [remote method invocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern#Remote_proxy).

The `server` and `client`s in the diagrams represent two new components. These components will live on separate machines: the `server` on the same system as `RefereeActor` and `TournamentManager`, and `client`s on the same machines as `PlayerActor`s. The `server` and `client`s will communicate with one-another via remote method invocation and JSON according to the protocol defined above.

The `server` component will expose an API for a `RefereeActor` or `TournamentManager` (or other future server-side component) to call to interact with a `PlayerActor`. When called, the `server` will serialize input to JSON, send it to a `client`, which in turn de-serializes the information and calls the `PlayerActor` accordingly. If there is a response, the `client` serializes it, sends it to the `server`, where it is de-serialized and handled accordingly.

Further mechanics of tournaments (organization, who advances, rules of games, end conditions, etc) are specified across the class site.
