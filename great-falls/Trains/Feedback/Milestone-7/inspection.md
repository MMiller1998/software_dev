#### Game Map : Total(30/30)
- (5/5) the item in todo file or an explanation for fixing an issue "immediately"
- (5/5) a link to a git commit (or set of) and/or git diffs
- (5/5) check accuracy 
- (15/15) quality(Should answer - how are connections between two cities represented?, is every connection between two cities represented once or twice?, does the data representation say how to translate it into a graphic layout?)

#### Game States : Total(30/30)
- (5/5) the item in your todo file or an explanation for fixing an issue "immediately"
- (5/5) a link to a git commit (or set of) and/or git diffs
- (5/5) check accuracy 
- (15/15) quality(should answer - a proper data definition including an interpretation for the player game state, a purpose statement for the "legality" functionality on player game states and connections, two unit tests for the "legality" functionality on states and connections)

#### Strategy : Total(30/30)
- (5/5) the item in your todo file or an explanation for fixing an issue "immediately"
- (5/5) a link to a git commit (or set of) and/or git diffs
- (5/5) check accuracy
- (15/15) quality(do the purpose statements of the strategies' methods/functions express how it makes decisions?, abstraction of common pieces) 
    
#### Referee's Scoring - Connection Points : Total(25/30)
- (0/5) the item in your todo file or an explanation for fixing an issue "immediately" 
  - This is because if you didn't have the item in the TODO, you were required to have some explanation of why this isn't the case, something as simple as "We already did this, no need for it in the TODO". For all the places you directly provided a link to the file, this was expected. But I am giving -5 only once.
- (5/5) a link to a git commit (or set of) and/or git diffs  
- (5/5) check accuracy 
- (15/15) quality(separate method, clear naming/purpose statement, unit tests)

#### Referee's Scoring - Destinations Connected : Total(30/30)
- (5/5) the item in your todo file or an explanation for fixing an issue "immediately" 
- (5/5) a link to a git commit (or set of) and/or git diffs
- (5/5) check accuracy 
- (15/15) quality(separate method, clear naming/purpose statement, unit tests)
#### Referee's Scoring - Longest Path : Total(30/30)
- (5/5) the item in your todo file or an explanation for fixing an issue "immediately" 
- (5/5) a link to a git commit (or set of) and/or git diffs
- (5/5) check accuracy 
- (15/15) quality(separate method, clear naming/purpose statement, unit tests)
  - Do not use magic constants, '20' in your case for longest path score.
#### Referee's Scoring - Ranking : Total(25/30)
- (5/5) the item in your todo file or an explanation for fixing an issue "immediately"
- (5/5) a link to a git commit (or set of) and/or git diffs 
- (5/5) quick-check accuracy 
- (10/15) quality(separate method, clear naming/purpose statement, unit tests)
  - (-5) You should include tests that verify that ranking method returns the player's in the correct order.
